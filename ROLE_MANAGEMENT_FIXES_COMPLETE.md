## **✅ Issue 1: Role Change Functionality Fixed**

### **Problem Solved:**

- "No role changes are available" error resolved
- Role transition matrix now properly enforced
- Cloud Functions properly handle role validation

### **Fixes Applied:**

1. **Enhanced Error Handling in RoleChangeModal:**

   - Added detailed logging for debugging
   - Better error messages showing specific failures
   - Console logging for troubleshooting

2. **Role Matrix Validation:**

   - ✅ `user` ↔ `business_person` ↔ `investor` ↔ `business_advisor`
   - ❌ `banker` and `admin` restricted (empty arrays)
   - Proper TypeScript type handling for role matrix

3. **Cloud Function Improvements:**
   - Fixed TypeScript type casting issues
   - Proper role validation logic
   - Comprehensive error logging

### **Testing Steps:**

## **✅ Issue 2: Login Role Selection Fixed**

### **Problem Solved:**

- Users can now select role during login
- Restricted roles (banker/admin) properly blocked
- Role validation during authentication

### **Fixes Applied:**

1. **Enhanced Auth.tsx:**

   ```typescript
   // Role selection during login
   <Label htmlFor="role">
     {isLogin ? "Login as... (optional)" : "I am a... *"}
   </Label>
   ```

2. **Role Validation Logic:**

   ```typescript
   const restrictedRoles = ["banker", "admin"];
   if (restrictedRoles.includes(formData.role)) {
     setError("❌ You cannot log in as banker. That role is restricted...");
     return;
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic Role Change:**
   - Uses `changeUserRole()` function during login
   - Updates Auth claims and Firestore document
   - Proper error handling for failed role changes

### **Testing Steps:**

1. Go to login page
2. Enter credentials
3. Select different role (e.g., investor when registered as user)
4. Should login successfully with new role
5. Try selecting "Banker" - should show restriction error
